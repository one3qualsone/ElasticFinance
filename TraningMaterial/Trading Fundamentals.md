# Warrens 4 Rules:
## Rule 1 - Company must have vigilant leaders
Vigilance means looking for danger. the biggest danger to any company on the stock market is debt. We manage it with debt to equity and current ratio.
### Debt to Equity
(all liabilities that refer to debt)
Debt / Equity has to be below .50
### Current ratio
(all current assets / all current liabilities)
For current ratio, above > 1.5

## Rule 2 - A stock must have long term prospects
We are looking at capitol gains tax and short v long-term gains of different companies. Capital gains tax becomes less over time and you only pay tax on dividends. 

## Rule 3 - A stock must be stable and understandable
Look at the debt/equity ratio, look at the debt and equity separately. Does the debt go down over time? Does the equity go up over time? Is it predictable?

Do you understand the stock? Do you know why it is valuable? does the companies product have value for future profits? If people understand it, know it, and have emotion around it, they are likely to buy it in the future.
