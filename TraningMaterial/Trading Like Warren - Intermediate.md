# Financial Risk
## Risk v Reward
the risk is you could loose all your money, reward is making money without doing much for it. 

You tend to have high risk high reward. Taking on more risk and reward is down to personal choice. 

You want to find more reward than there are risks. 

## Baseline value for risk and reward

## What causes financial risk
There are a few:
- debt - debt is an asset but it is a risk. You take on debt to speed up time. we borrow to buy a home instead of buying one in 20 years. With companies it is the same thing
- Value - Companies can seem valuable but unless you look closely, they may be swimming naked and when the tide goes out is the only time you can tell. Do not over pay for assets. know the worth and pay under value. 
- Understanding - Risk comes from not knowing what you are buying.

As the company takes on more debt, the company becomes less productive in the long run. 

"when the tide goes out you see who has been swimming naked."

The price is what you pay. the value is what you get. 

How is overpaying on a stock any different to buying a house over what market value is for it? 

There is no difference. 

- excessive debt
- overpaying
- not knowing what you are buying. 

# What is inflation
## What is it?
money being worth less over time as it is printed more

David works to take out the rubbish and gets $4 for it from his parents. David can trade this money for the work that is done by someone else. 

He goes and buys some milk for $4. If he waited a year to buy the milk, the milk is now $4.12. He now cant buy the milk. this was because of inflation but what caused this??

Take 4 people where the FED paid 1,000 to them
two years later, they get paid 1,200. with 1,200 the milk can go up more as there is more money in the system. 

## How and why does the government inflate the currency?
A moderate amount of inflation protects the country from deep recessions and depressions. It serves as an indirect form of taxation. 

Primary cause is FED increasing supply of money. 

The FED raises inflation by either directly printing more money or by going directly to the bank. 

When you save money with a bank, they are allowed to take a proportion of that money (80%) and re-invest it. so if i save 1,000 they can lend 800 of my savings. This bank pays 800 to someone who puts it in their savings. they then can use $540 from those savings and pass to the next person. this allows an economy to grow. 1,000 in the system turns into 5,000. 

Reserve ratio is how much the bank can lend and how much it has to keep on hand. 

1 / reserve ratio
1 / .2 = 5

What happens when the reserve ratio changes? 
The amount of money you can lend goes down or up. 

1 /.1 = 10 
meaning we can lend 900 and keep 100 in the reserve. 
## How does inflation affect bonds and stocks? 
### Bonds
Dan lends 1,000 to amy to buy a bond with the coupon at 5%
During the year, 5% inflation occurs during that time frame. 
Amy gives back 1,000 and gives the 5% coupon so dan has 1,050
Due to 5% inflation, 1,000 in 2013 money is 1,050. Dan has made no money because his buying power is exactly the same. 

How does inflation impact bonds? Very badly. 

Bond Yield - Inflation rate = actual bond yield.
TIPS = Treasury inflation - protected security

### Stocks
Dan buys 1,000 of apple. 5% inflation occurs during the same year. 

From apples standpoint their cost of materials are 100, they sell at 200, net income is 100
Year 2013, cost of materials are 105, sales = 210, net income = 105. 

Apple automatically adjusted this price to their customers, so their net income was raised by 5%. If the multiple was the same, Dans shares are now worth 1,050. we also have net income via dividends. 

Stocks with no debt are generally unaffected by inflation like bonds are. 



# What is the S and P rating
There are 3 rating companies, 
Fitch, Moodys and S&P

If you are worried about a company, you can look up their financial page and look at their bonds. if you see tripple A bonds, you believe they have a great chance at paying you back. Ratings are interesting. Mooodys is half the risk as an AAA on S&P

# Yield Curves
## What is a yield curve
Everyone wants to predict the future. One of our analysing tools we have is a yield curve. 
A yield curve is a % return in terms of yield over the term (years) 

An inverse yield curve is one that is starting high and goes low over time in terms of yield. 

Right now, looking at yield curves, we start low and end high on the term. 

Yield curves are valuable for seeing how the government is trying to steer the economy. The fed tries to control bubbles with inverse yield curves. 

When the fed is trying to increase spending, it creates a positive yield curve. 

## How can I use a yield curve to predict market behaviour?
looking at how the government are establishing bonds and yields of their federal notes shows us the direction they are trying to take the economy. 

- Yields are a valuable tool for understanding how the government is trying to steer the economy
- We calculate intrinsic value in the next episode we will be using the value found for a 10 year federal note

When you see an inverted yield curve, the fed is predicting a recession at that point. 


# How to use a bond Calculator
## How does the price of a bond change with interest rates
In the year 2012 you buy a bond
- par = $1000
- Coupon = 5%
- Term = 30 years

Year 2013:
- Par Value = 1,000
- Coupon 4%
- Term 30 Years

We are holding a 5% bond, where the bonds made this year are at 4%. What is the value of our bond? 
This goes up to 1169 from our initial 1,000. This is because if you were to buy a 5% bond, when interest rates have dropped and 4% bonds are the only ones available, you you will make this $169 over the rest of the term of the bond. 
## How to use a bond calculator
Lets assume we buy a bond but the coupon value goes up. how much is ours worth? less. 
How can you buy these bonds at the right time? Yield Curves. When there is an inverted yield curve, that is the time to be buying those bonds. 


# Buffets 4 rules for investing:
- A stock must be managed by vigilant leaders
- A stock must have long term prospects
- stable and understandable
- undervalued. 
All 4 most be met
## Rule 1 A stock must be managed by vigilant leaders
### Define Vigilant leadership
Vigilant means to be carefully observant or attentive, on the lookout for danger. 
What are the dangers?
- Debt 

We have two rules that help us find this danger:
- Debt to equity ratio
- current ratio
### Debt to Equity ratio
If you add up all your debts = 20,000
If you added up all your Equity = 100,000
The debt / Equity = .2
Warren buffet likes it to be <.50
for every dollar of equity, the company has 50C of debt.

How do you find debt?
You go to the liabilities section of the company and add up everything that has 'debt' in the name. add them up and device by the total equity. 
### Understand Current Ratio
How will the company handle debt in the next 12 months? 
It compares current assets to the current liabilities. 

Warren likes the Current ratio to be above > 1.5

on a balance sheet, we have total current assets and total assets. Current assets means the company will likely take those assets and convert for money in the next 12 months. 

In the liabilities section, you have Total current liabilities which is what the company will pay off in the next 12 months. 

Current Assets / Current Liabilities should be above 1.5
### What levels of debt are acceptable
for Debt to equity, below <.50
For current ration, above > 1.5


## Rule 2 - A stock must have long term prospects
Here, we are looking mainly at identifying companies with long term prospects and capital gains tax:
### How to identify a company with long term prospects
Go through the companies main selling points. is this something we still see as being used 30 years from now? Do we see oil being used? Potentially, but declining. Do we see phones being used? Yes.

When looking at a company and their primary product, you need to look for ones with long term prospects. This is the assessment you have to do regardless of what you think about the company. 
### What is capital gains tax?
Why do we invest long term?
- Sustained Earnings
- Taxes
If you buy a stock, the longer you hold it for, the less you have to pay on Capital gains tax.

### What is the difference between short and long term gains?
short term is less than a year, long term is over 1 year. it makes a difference to your capitol gains tax. and it is a huge difference. As someone in England with an ISA, this is not an issue. 

If you paid 55,000 into an investment over 20 years recieving 10% a year, you would start with 55,000 and end with 336,000. you would then pay $60 in taxes as you do get taxed on dividends but not on the gain. 

If we are constantly selling and buying, we pay 73,000 a year each year. We also only make 161,000
## Rule 3 - A stock must be stable and understandable
## Why stability is important for determining intrinsic value
As an example, we are tracking Andrews earnings and equity for the last 10 years. Over the last 10 years, equity has been up and down. earnings have been going up and up. Hid debt has been all over the place. 

How much equity would Andrew have in 10 years? hard to predict. 

Linda has a steady equity graph. it is much easier to estimate were she would be. The buisness we want to invest in is predictable We need solid equity. 

unpredictability is risk. 

Looking at Disney vs SIRI shows similar outputs. 

Look at book value per share (book value is equity) how does it look on a timechart?
look at the debt to equity ratio, how does it look on a time chart?
EPS (earnings per share)

understanding this in a simple chart, helps to see how the company will be in the future. 

We still have to guess where the company is going to be, but we have to predict this. 
## Why it is important to invest in a company that you understand
If we understand it, we can predict it, keeping it as simple as it can be can be hedging your bets in the right direction.

Do you understand it? Is it known to you? this is what people do think about when investing. Dont follow the crowd or you will end up like crypto. 


## Rule 4 - A stock must be undervalued. 
### Calculating the intrinsic value of a stock
How do we tell if a stock is undervalued? well, it is a mixture of hard numbers, equity, debt and behaviour of the leaders of the company. Needs to be stable to predict the intrinsic value of a company. 

- Manageable debt
- Long Term prospects
- stability
	-  book value
	- equity / debt
- Market price = 44.33
	- Intrinsic price = ?

### How do we determine intrinsic value of a company?
It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life. Intrinsic value is an estimate, an estimate that must be changed if interest rates move or forecasts of future cashflows are revised. 

What does cash taken out of a business during remaining life mean? 
If I can take out all the profit that that company will make over X number of years, how much will that add up to? We will do it for 10 years into the future. 

- EPS is the magic number. it is the profit per share. 
- Option 1
	- e.g $1.50 comes in as EPS
	- we can invest or pay debts
	- EPS money either turns into more equity, or less equity. this is shown in the book value (equity per share)
- Option 2 
	- Dividend

Companies will often take a portion of EPS and put it in to equity, and also as a dividend.
you often wont see the EPS return in your dividend because they are re-investing, paying off debts or adding to the company in the form of equity. 

When we total the EPS over the last 10 years and compare to the dividend:
![[Pasted image 20230808162033.png]]
As the equity per share is higher than the dividend, we have actually lost $2 that should have gone to us. When we are talking about the cash that can be taken out of a company through the term, we can assume the company is going to keep operating at this efficiency. 

We have to estimate how this book value is going to grow over the next 10 years. 

That £13 was accumulated over the last 10 years, we need to know what it will gain over the next 10 years. if book value is growing linearly, predict using that. Stability is everything. you cant predict without stability. 

Always look at projected earnings to ensure estimated cashflows are realistic. If analysts are predicting much lower earnings, that is something you want to run away from. 

"the percentage change in book value in any given year is likely to be close to that years change in intrinsic value"

### Calculating Value
Calculating book value increases over last period:
- Current book value = $20
- Old book value = $10 (oldest book value)
- Years between book values = 10
- Average book value change = %7.17

Calculating future book value over current period:
Cash taken out of business = .30 (dividend pay-outs over the period(can use mean average calculator if more sporadic))
Current book value = $20
Average percent change in book value = 7.17% (what we expect BV to grow at)
Years = 10 (how long we want to invest for)
interest rate on 10 year federal note = 1.7 (interest rate of the US?)
Calculate

## Live example
Calculating book value increases over last period:
- Current book value = $21.21
- Old book value = $11.61
- Years between book values = 9 (first year is baseline not growth)
- Average book value change = 6.924%



Calculating future book value over current period:
Cash taken out of business = .60 (keep it as the same as the newest value, but it depends on the company. If you are happy they are being conservative with dividend pay-outs then don't worry)
Current book value = 21.21
Average percent change in book value = 6.924%
Years = 10
interest rate on 10 year federal note = 1.71
Calculate = 40.43
The current market price is $44.33
This is over valued. 

NOTE Dividend payouts will likely have to be found on a companies website, not on the stock market. you want the DIVIDEND RATE, NOT Yield. 

### Elastic example
current equity = 398,897,000
current shares outstanding = 96,000,000
old equity = -153.529
old shares outstanding = 87,000,000
years = 4

Current BV = 4.15
Old BV = -1.7
Average book change = 176.55974527015275

# Preferred share
## What is a preferred share?
The lowest risk you have on a share is a bond. the preferred share is in the middle, between common stock and a bond. 
- bond - least risk
- preferred share - medium risk
- common share - higher risk

A preferred share performs like a bond. When you buy one, instead of a coupon you get a dividend. you will only get the proportion of that business if it liquidates. it then goes to the bond holders, then preferred share holders then common share holders. The bond holders are the only ones who get items to be kept in the business. 

### How does it work?
where a bond has a term, a preferred share also has a term. face value = price for the share and dividend is the pay-out per year. 

a lot of preferred shares dont have 10 or 20 year terms. its more common to be perpetual (it will be out there untill the company buys it back.)

## What should we consider when buying one?
### Certificate of designation
The share has a certificate of designation stating how the share will operate. you need to read this to understand the terms and conditions of the preferred share. 

### Why would companies issue a preferred share? 
they can raise a lot of money and have flexibility to write the certificate of designation to help them. they can let dividend payments accumulate and pay later. you really need to read it. they may not even pay out dividends. 

- it allows the company to retain the equity of the business for common share holders. The only time the equity of the company materialises on a preferred share is if the company liquidates. 
- cumulative preferred = eventually get dividend, stops you from compounding your dividend but its on the goodwill of the company. 
- non-cumulative preferred - the company doesn't have to pay you a dividend. never buy this. 
- term - many preferred shares are perpetual. 
- holding perpetual with low yield will almost always end poorly for the investor. value will never return to face value and most likely continue to trade on market well below issuing price. 
- most preferred shares have adjustable dividend rate that is tied to the current interest rate benchmark.
