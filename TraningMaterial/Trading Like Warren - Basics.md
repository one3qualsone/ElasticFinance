# Value Investing 
## Value Trading
Value Trading is holding a trade where it does not become more valuable, but rather using it to trade for something more valuable. 

## Value Investing
Value investing is buying somthing that continues to generate money as you hold owner ship of it, putting money in your pocket while the asset grows over time. 

## Asset Vs Liability
Asset is somthing that gains value over its life span and generates income at the same time
Liability is an asset which depreciates in value from what you originally paid for it. 

### Example with warren buffet:
Here is a company called seize candy. I'm going to look at all their financials and determine what the company is worth. After analysis we determine it is $40 a share. 

We look at the market price and see it is at $30 per share. Ok I will now buy these at a great deal. while I own, i will continue to get paid for owning this asset. We get monthly sales from what profit the company makes, while the company value continues to row. 

# How warren buffet invests
He doesnt care about the stock market. He goes into a company, looks at the financials, works out what he thinks the company is worth and then looks at what it is actually trading at. Warren attributes his investing knowladge to two books. Security Analysis and Intelegent investor. These are not entry level investing books. 

# Valuing a small buisness
## Small Buisness Model
1 Owner. Owners own the business. 
2 Owner has an idea to bring in a new ice cream stand. Employees run everything, at the end of the year, you get a paycheck for that ownership. 
3 You need to have customers.

## How Money flows. 
example over an hour
- Revenue = $100 - money spent from customers
- costs = $70 - Employee, Material, Rent
- income before taxes = $10 - full income before taxed
- Net income or Earnings = $20 - money that goes to the owner. 

NEVER FORGET NET INCOME / EARNININGS. 
Net Income is full income for the company, earnings can often be broken down per share. 

The owner can choose to take the money, or re-invest in the business. A lot of businesses will do both by taking a cut and putting money back in for further upgrades. 

When talking about stocks, the money going to the owner is called a dividend and the money going back into the business can be retained in the equity. 

# Small Vs Large Buisness
- Owner = Board of Directors / Share holders. Board of directors represent share holders for the buisness.
- Employee = CEO and all other employees
- Customer = Customer

# 2. Valuing a business
a business trading at £30 but how do we figure out it should actually be at £40?
We will use the example for the small buisness to figure this out:
- Revenue = 100,000
- Cost of Revenue = 70,000
- Income before tax = 30,000
- Net income = 20,000

if Nancy was to sell this shop, how much is it worth as it makes 20k a year with little risk?
-  would you pay 400,000? This would return about 5% investment | 20x the earnings
- would you pay 100,000? This would return about 10% investment | 10x the earnings
- would you pay 100,000? This would return about 20% investment | 5x the earnings
The business never changed. but the return at different price points becomes worse the more you spend. If you over pay for a stock, the percent you get goes down significantly. What is the stock worth?

Warren buffet looks at companies that trade for less than 15 times their earnings. 
## Live example
Rio Tinto has net income of 12Bn this year. 15x the earnings would be around 196Bn. If it is below this, it is a solid purchase. 

# 3. What is a balance sheet and margin of safety
## Understand importance of balance sheet
What is a balance sheet?
We are going to use the example from point 2 where nancy has 20k net income. We assume Nancy wants to sell the business for 200,000 At this price and at 20k net income we would have a 10% return, but how safe is that investment? thats what we will figure out with a balance sheet. 

### Balance Sheet
Any corporation has 3 pieces of paper that they have to account for:
- Income statement - revinue, cost of revinue, net income
- Balance sheet
- Cashflow Statement - dont worry about this now. 

We can use the balance sheet to determine the margin of safety that we would get if we purchase the business. 

What would happen if the business would liquidate (Turn whole business into cash) right now? To do that, you sum all your assets, sum all liabilities and the difference is the equity:



## How to determine equity of a business
$Total Assets - $Total Liabilities = Equity

Its as simple as that. 

Total assets:
- Cash in account 3,000
- Ice Cream stand 10,000
- Ice Cream Machine 5,000
- Supplies 1,000
- Land 25,000
Total 44,000

Total Liabilities
- Salary Owed 2,000
- Ice-cream Stand (left to pay off) 9,000
- Ice cream Machine (left to pay off) 3,000
- Land (left to pay off) 23,000
Total 37,000

40,000 - 37,000 = 7,000

It may be making 20,000 a year in net income, but the equity on this balance sheet is $7,000. Do this yourself. how much you have in cash, how much you think your car is worth etc... Add up your assets, subtract your liabilities and see what your personal equity is. youll have a better idea of what a balance sheet really is. Equity is for the whole business. 

Book value is equity per share. 


## Understand a company's margin of safety
If Nancy couldn't find a buyer for her ice-cream stand she will only have 7,000. 
This is the difference between what a person is asking for and the equity in the company, is the risk. If a buisness doesnt have a substantial amount of safety between equity and share price, that is risky. 

Lets say your company stops making money, whats the buisness worth? its worth the equity. The closer the equity to the market price, the safer the investment. 

You will get 10% year on year, but what if the variables change? what if your employee quits, machines break down, law suits etc...

The risk is high and the margin of safety is very low. The equity is 3.5% of the market price (asking price)

If the equity was 150k and net income was 20,000 it would be easy as little risk. 

## Understand business value - a comparison of net income and equity
Owner can pay themselves or pay back into the business. Lets assume Nancy puts money back into the business and pays off debts. Although the net income is lower, the equity is higher as she is paying off her liabilities. 

# 4. What is a share? 
## What is a share? 
Nancy is having issues selling for 200,000 and tries to sell for 100,000. She is going to break down the company into shares. She divides the company up in to 10,000 little pieces by taking what she wants for it and dividing by 10,000 to make a share 10 dollars. Shares outstanding is how many little pieces the company has been split up into. 
## What is shares outstanding?
Shares outstanding is how many pieces a company is split up into.
## Comparing terminology between a whole business and 1 share
When looking at 1 share of the buisness which has been broken down, the terminology changes from what we had. 

- 1 share
- Shares outstanding (how many times the business has divided) = 10,000
- Market price (asking price) = £10 share
- Earnings (net income) = $2
- Book value (equity) = $0.70





## Basic valuation techniques for 1 share
The best way to value a share is to pretend 1 share is a miniature business. remember, net income 
EPS = Earnings per share. 
When you go to a balance sheet, the equity is the book value. 

## Price to earnings ratio:
You take the market price and divide against the EPS
10/2 = 5

What does this mean? why is P/E important?

for every 'x' dollars, i should receive 1 dollar in profit each year. The best way to understand it is to say what ever the price to earnings ration is:

For every <P/E value> dollars I spend buying this stock, I should receive 1 dollar in profit a year later. 

## Why is stock investing so lucrative?
Would you buy Nancy's business for 1m dollars? no. but what is apple worth?

Its hard to say. easy when you have just one company like nancys icecream shop, but large billion dollar companies with billions of shares? You may hear that the company is $20 a share, but what does that mean? what is its actual value? to understand this, you have to analyse the company as if you were buying the whole company. 

what you find in the stock market is people buying on emotion. 

Always calculate the intrinsic value of the buisness and buy off that. 

# 5. Live example
JNJ
1. income statement
2. Balance sheet
3. Cashflow Statement

## Income statement
Total Revenue = all money
Cost of Revenue = operating expenses
Net income = profit

## Balance Sheet (how much the company is worth today)
you want to know what the company is worth right now. 
- Total Assets
- Total Liabilities

in a good company, total assets will be double liabilities. 

We will take a look at the EPS (Earnings per share) being 3.48. 
Shares outstanding is 5 billion. 
The book value is the equity divided by all the shares to show us the equity per share. 

book value is $20 
Margin of safety should mean the market price should be less than 15x the book value. The closer the market price is to the book value the better. And should be ok so long as the earnings per share remain positive. 

## Putting it together
We know what the buisness is worth from their equity ($57bn)
We know the company's net income this year is $9bn
We  will divide the buisness up by 2bn shares
We will look at the EPS (Earnings per share (net income)) which is 3.5.
The book value is 20.9 (to work out book value it is equity / shares)
Margin of safety is the book value against the market price which is $60. 
This means the margin of safety is 1/3
PE ratio is market price divided by the the earnings (how many dollars i wil spend to get 1 back.)

# Warren buffets trading style
## Buffets 4 rules for buying stocks
Buffet likes to view things very simple. 

- Stock has to be stable and understandable - you need to be able to predict where it will be in the future.
- A stock must have a long term prospect - Good way to avoid tax
- Stock must be managed by good leaders - people who manage debt well. Stay away from companies with a lot of debt.
- A stock must be undervalued. - Determine the intrinsic value of the company and do not overpay. 
Each of these need to be met. granted finding this out may be a bit more difficult.
## Valuation Technique
Number 4. a stock must be undervalued. How do you find undervalued stocks? 
- Market price = 10 
- earnings = 2
- P/E = 10 / 2 = 5
- Return 20%

P/E = 25 Return 4%
P/E = 20 Return 5%
P/E = 15 Return 6.6%
P/E = 10 Return 10%
P/E = 5 Return 20%
When P/E is low, you can expect margin of safety to be worse. 

Lets take a price to the book value:
P / BV
10 / 0.70 = 14.3
Every 14.3 dollars you spend buying this company, the company has $1 in book value.

P / BV = 5 Safety = 20%
P / BV = 3 Safety = 33%
P / BV = 2 Safety = 50%
P / BV = 1.5 Safety = 67%
P / BV = 1 Safety = 100%
P / BV = .7 Safety =143%

So what are we doing with these values now? We have our price to earnings and price to book value. What buffet does is look across stocks to find low P/E < 15 and P/BV < 1.5

What we can do is multiply these together to get a P/E * P/BV < 22.5. 

This is a great way to filter stocks. If we run Nancy's business through this tool we will get 71.5. Not a buy:
```
Nancy Buisness:
P = 10
E = 2
BV = 0.70

10 / 2 = 5
10 / 0.70 = 15.2
5 * 15.2 = 76
76 < 22.5? 
False
```
## Opinion on the market
He buys a company with the assumption that the market will close and re-open in 5 years and he still makes money. Some days you'll get bad buys and others great deals. Your job is to know when it is a good deal. 

You will not be successful without patience and stick to your fundamentals. 

Think for yourself. do not base your buys off other peoples opinions. 


## Patience and individuality
You will not be successful without patience and stick to your fundamentals. 

Think for yourself. do not base your buys off other peoples opinions. 

# Bond valuation and techniques
## What is a bond
A bond is a loan. Example:
Jack needs to finance 500,000,000 dollars for a new building. 
How does jack get that much money? He goes to a bank. they sit down and do an assessment on the health of the company like how we did our calculations. 

The bank then determines the bank is healthy enough to give such a large loan. How is the bank going to issue the money? Through a bond. 

The bank creates 500,000 bonds each at the value of 1,000. the banks are going to take these bonds and sell them to investors. The bank comes up with a rough coupon rate based on the risk, the interest rate at the time and they issue a coupon rate of 5%. 

As Jack comes in, the bank has not issued the bonds, but they give jack the money. After that, they distribute these bonds to investors. 

The bank will charge 1,005 dollars for each bond sold. that $5 is the fee where the banks make their money.

When the investor receives the bond they will receive 5% of the 'par' value of the bond (1,000) NOT the amount they paid for it. 

Every year they make 5% on their bond. At the end of the term of the bond, the company (jack) pays back the price of the bond to the investors (1,000). NOT the bank. 

Just to double back from a different perspective, After jack receives the money he then needs to start paying back the $25 to the investors. If the bank continues to hold onto the bonds, they will be paid, but the bank always wants investors to come and buy that bond from them. 

Once the bank has sold off all the bonds, the relationship is just between Jack and the investors. Jack pays the investors $25 each half year up untill the end of the term of the loan. Once the bond matures, Jack then has to pay all the investors $1,000. 

## Who uses bonds
Corporations 
Federal
Countries (Gov). 

The same risk calculation is done on the banks for both gov and corp. They need to be sure the state can repay the government 
interest rate they make the bond for is corresponding to the ability to pay it off. 

Federal level is a 0 risk investment as they can print more money to fulfil the coupon payments. 


## Bond Risks
- Government or company failure - 15 years later, maybe a new board of directors, company may be incapable to trade bonds. 
- When interest rates go up the bond value goes up, but if you buy a bond at a low rate, and interest spikes, you are loosing money. 
- If Inflation goes up then you may end up loosing money. You need to understand subtracting inflation to calculate profit. 

Lets assume you hold a bond for a failed company. When you liquidate assets, the order of equity distribution always starts with the bond holders. Then the preferred share holders and common share holders. Thats what is great about bonds. 
## Why is bond investing lucrative
Why would you invest in a bond? 
Looking at the 2008 crash, in 2007 the bond rate was 5%. 
The average stock price P/E is 27 in 2007. our return at that time is 3.7%. But bonds are at 5%.

Lets look at 2009. Average bond is 2.83% and Stock P/E is 15, return of 6.7%. 
In this case, the stocks are the better choice. You need to make sure to do your comparison to know what you should be buying. 

As interest rates drop, you are making money. As the price of interest drops, you are holding a more valuable bond which means the price for that bond goes up. 

# Components of a Bond
## What is par value?
Lets take a look at the bond from the investor perspective.
Lets break down a bond:
- Bond name
- conditions
	- Face/par value = bond price (also what we receive when the bond matures)
	- Coupon Rate: annual amount in % of the original bond value (e.g 5% per 6 months so $25 per half year)
- Term
	- date of issue - this is when you pay 1,000 and from when your coupons will be tracked
	- Date of maturity
- Coupons
	- 1/60 redeemable on oct 1 2012
	- 2/60 Reedeemable on may 1 2013
Adding up the coupon rate for the entire year is the percent. 
## What is a coupon?
the % paid on the original bond


## What is the Term?
How long you will have the bond for, and how often you receive pay-outs. 



## What is market value for a bond? 
Market value of the same bond changes through time. 
5 years later, lets say interest rates are 6% as you are getting a 5% coupon, your rate has gone down and the value of ther bond is less. 

15 years later, if the interest is still at 6%, the value goes up to $902. 

29 years later, interest at 6% the value still goes up to $990. why is this? 

If you buy the bond at the one year mark, you are going to recieve two checks and get back your 1,000. The longer you hold the bond, the bond is going to approach its face value. The longer the bond has before it comes mature, the market value is going to change. If buying high yeild in bonds, you need to invest in a good stable company. 

If the interest rate drops, the bond value will go up. 

If you buy a long term bond and expect interest to drop, you can make a lot of safe money on it. 

When interest rates go up, bond prices go down. 


## How do you value a bond?
We have this bond from jessie, there are two ways jessie can value these Simple and compound interest
## Understand simple interest
Simple interest is two things:
- Coupon Yield
- Current Yield

To understand simple interest, we add up the value of all the coupons
Coupon 1 = $25
Coupon 2 = $50
...
Coupon 60 = $1,500
If jessie keeps the bond and holds it, he will receive 1,500 in interest. The coupon yield is taking 1 year of par value divided by the price paid for it. 
50 / 1000 = $20
## Current Yield
Current yield is the coupon par value over the year vs the original amount paid for it. 
50 / 1000 * 100 = 5%

If at a price of 1200 and coupon of 50, when the bond matures, you will have $200 less than at the 1000 rate because the current yield is 4.2% not 5%

If you buy the bond at $800, then you have made profit.


## Understand compound interest
Compound interest is
- Yield to Maturity
In this example, the interest compounds over time:
Coupon 1 = $25
Coupon 2 = $51
Coupon 3 = $77
...
Coupon 60 = 3,400

The first $25 that we receive, Jesse invests that in something that grows in interest at a rate of rate of 5%. 
## Yield to maturity
Yield to maturity is a difficult calculation. Essentially it is the Par value / market price / time left on the bond. This doesnt take into account compound interest and here is the full equation:
![[Pasted image 20230805122644.png]]

B 0 = Bond price
C = Anbnual coupon payment
F = face value of the bond
YTM = yield to maturity on the bond
t = Number of years remaining untill maturity. 

Yeild to maturity accounts for the difference between the price that you pay and the face value. 

Jesse buys a bond that has been on the market for 15 years. This means there is 15 years left untill the bonds mature. 

Jesse pays more for the bond, at $1200
- Coupon payments = $1,098
- Par gain/loss = - $200
- Difference = $898
- Yield to maturity = 3.3%

In the example with no purchase price to face value change, the yield would be 5% even if bought after 15 years. 

Understanding Yield to maturity is super important. 

Lets take a look at an example:

|                   | 800  | 1000 | 1200 |
|-------------------|------|------|------|
| Coupon Yield      | 5%   | 5%   | 5%   | 
| Current Yield     | 6.3% | 5%   | 4.2% | 
| Yield To Maturity | 7.2% | 5%   | 3.3% |
Coupon Yield = coupon payment throughout the year / par value (NOT Market Value)
Current Yield = Coupon payment throughout the year / Price paid
Yield to Maturity = Price we are paying vs face value of the bond

# The stock market
## What is the stock market?
### Fundamentals:
Market is where we can trade money for items. 
The stock market is where we trade for partial ownership of a company.

If i go to a supermarket and buy a peach for $1, who determines the price of that peach? To determine, it is actually determined by both the seller and the market. The value of something is only what people are willing to buy it for, and what sellers are willing to sell it for. 

Lets say we have more sellers. This means the price will go down as there is not any demand. As a buyer you will buy from the cheapest seller. 

Vice versa, with one peach seller and 100 buyers, the seller is able to control the price and raise it for that peach. 

In the stock market, this is exactly how it works. 

### Stock





## How does the stock market work?
Lets take one share of JNJ and we want to sell at $65
We have a broker who will link up a seller and a buyer for the exchange. Amy has the ability to put this up for 1 day or 30 days if someone is willing to buy it. You need to be careful with stop orders. If we put a stop order in at $65, and sold 10 shares, but the other 90 someone was only willing to buy at $64 these would get executed. for larger orders, Amy could get less than $65 if she has more than one buyer. 
## What is a limit and stop order?
Trevor wants to buy a share at $64. Trevor puts in a stop order at $64. 
Here, we have a discrepancy. If we assume every seller wants to sell at $65 and all buyers at $64, no transactions would occur. 

Curt has one share of JNJ, instead he puts in a market order which says anyone who wants to buy, what ever you want to buy it for, ill sell it to you. 

The buyer bought from curt as it was cheaper. The price on the stock market will now be listed at $64. 

Vice versa, Linda wants to buy JNJ for what ever the seller is willing to sell it for. Linda executes at $65 and now both sellers have executed their shares. Looking at this scenario, jus because something is trading at that value, doesn't mean it is worth that amount. That is what Value investing is. it is looking at what the value of the company is vs what people pay for it. 
## Ben Grantham's Mr Market. 
Mr market is an emotionally disturbed business partner. Mr Market is a servant, not a guide. Mr Market may say hey buy this stock, creates this emotion around the market. Then he can also be saying I'm going to take all your money, if you think you'll make money your kidding yourself. 

No. What you have to do is remain calm and confident. understand the market and know where the value is. Mr Market is providing good and crap deals. do not follow his emotion. capitalise on what its doing. Do not be fooled by the emotion. 


# Market Crashes and bubbles
## Fear and Greed Cycles
What are instincts? In fearful situations, removing yourself. Waiting outside a restaurant as it has a long queue, waiting in the line to get in. Instinct is behaviour performed without knowledge or experience. 

You have to understand the fear and greed cycles. 

We have to be knowledgeful. base our opinions on facts, not opinions. Your mindset in greed cycle is we can get in and get out without information on the stock. 

Then the market corrects as people who understand the value of the stock pull out. When they dont understand the value, they get fear and pull out. How do we know what stocks are worth? The knowladge of a stock value means we can know if a stock is under or over valued. 


## Buffets opinion on market psychology
The key is to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.
## Accumulating shares vs Trading shares
In the short term, anyone can price a stock. in the log term the stock is what the value is. 

Amy is our value trader, Trevor is our emotion trader. 

Amy is looking at buying stock in american eagle, company earnings are $2 per share and $18 of book value. freat margin of safty. 1% dividend is ok. over all i think intrinsic value is probably $22 per share. 

If emotion based, wow i love american eagle, they got tons of stuff and the stock is going up. 

Amy buys at $20 per share. It is impossible to predict if the market will go up or down. 

This is how amy looks at the situation:
This is awesome! Although the companys earnings may have been down a little, its still worth at leased $20 per share. Since its trading at $15, i better get some more while its at a good price. 

Trevor thinks, ooh no what did i get myself into, i lost $500. i need to sell before i loose more!

Amy invests 2,000 at 133 shares. Trevor is going to just hold. 6 months go by and the stock doesn't change. Its now worth $21 based on the new earnings and balance sheet. Ill buy more shares. You need to know you are calculating right and know the value. 

Trevor continues to hold what he has.

Amy sells when it reaches $24 which is higher than what she thinks it is. 

You need to be looking at the financial data to be able to buy low and sell high. 

In the long term who is controlling the market price? In the short term, trevor is, in long term, Amy is.

# What is the FED?
## What is the FED
The fed is the united states federal reserve.

The fed manages the us currency and control the us economy. 
Prior to 1913, you would see 30,000 different currencies in circulation. After 1913 there was 1 federal currency. the dollar. 

The fed can bring stability to a volatile economy. The fed is a private institution. they get elected by the president and stay in for 12 years. it is owned by 12 federal reserve banks, commercial banks and forign banks along with individuals. 

Where does the money come from? FED can print it from thin-air. That's what happened in 2008. Much activity is not public knowledge. Many debate if it is even for the people. 




## What is the mission?
The fed tries to do 4 things:
- Maximise employment and stabilise prices
- Supervise and regulate banks
- Maintain stability of financial system 
- Service debts for the us federal government. 

How does the FED stabilise the financial system? They understand the 2008 fear and greed cycle very well. The federal reserve knew there was a bubble in the economy. The way they were going to prevent this bubble, is to raise interest rates. When interest rates are adjusted, 

when it crashes, interest rates are lowered. 

Lets say you get a 5k bonus and you want to buy a car with it. How much is it worth to you? 35,000 is the most you will spend. so you get a loan on the car using that money as a deposit. 

Car price at 30,000
interest rate 15%
Monthly payment 594
Total interest 10,687
Adjusted price 40,684

this is now higher than 35,000. 

Lets say we get the car with interest at 1%. your monthly interest over 5 years is 641 dollars. Adjusted is 30,641. 

The same car, same market price, but the interest rate is different giving us a different value at the end and different spending habits. The interest rates changed your spending habits. If they dont want you to buy something, interest rates go up. 


## How does the FED change market conditions with interest rates?
when markets getting high, raise interest rates to induce less spending. When the fed lowers interest rates, you are in a fear cycle. 

When interest rates are high, we want to be buying bonds. when the interest rates drop, the market price of the bond goes up. you then have the liquidity to sell it and get into the stock market. 

When this happens, you want to find a company with low debt, strong earnings and a strong price to book ratio. 

How do you know what is considered a high or low interest rate? You are constantly evaluating the return you will get with a stock, vs the return you will get with a bond. Lets assume base don the market price, the stock return may be 5%. when you look at the bond, that may be 5.5%. this is an easy decision. 

## What does the FED tell us about Mr Market?
It controls its dramatic cycles through introducing interest rates. 

# Video
## Credit
lenders want to make their money into more money. borrowers want to buy somthing they cant afford. Credit helps lenders and borrowers get what they want. 

When you borrow money, you get the principal which is the amount borrowed which you pay back every month. and the interest, which is the % on the principal paid back for the profit of the lender. 

When interest is low, more borrowers will buy meaning more money to the lender. if the lender believes the borrower can pay back the lender, it will give them the money opening up a line of credit. Credit is tricky because it has different names. 

Debt and Credit. Debt is a liability to the borrower. Why is credit so important? When a borrower recieves credit it is able to create an economy. when you spend more, someone else earns more.
